# single rule to match Makefile anywhere in project; rmake matches depth first,
# which works well with the traditional approach of using make to cd into
# submodule folders and build those before continuing to parent folders
rule Makefile

	# make requires that it be executed from the directory where the Makefile
	# is found; this ensures we are in the correct directory
    cd

	# for each Makefile matched by the rule, run 'make'
    cmd make
